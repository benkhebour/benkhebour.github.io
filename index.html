This institute is among the top 3 best (nation wide) in terms of results in the national exam. For 2 years, this educational system puts the student under immense stress situations to extract the best of their performances. Students that want to enter engineering schools must first study advanced Mathematics (Algebra, Calculus, Probability ...) advanced Physics (from Newtonian physics to Quantum physics), Computer Science, Chemistry (Thermodynamics), Mechanics, French and English. These institutes prepare its students to take a the very competitive national exam that would determine which engineering school each student goes to.</p>

As EPT is known to be the best school in Tunisia, its students are usually those who rank in the top 70 in the naitonal exam, with about 3600 students taking that exam every year, meaning EPT accepts the best 2% students each year. 
                      <br>EPT has a general engineering program, making sure that its students are familiar with various subjects such as Mathematics (stochastic processes, optimization, numerical analysis, ...), Physics (Finite Element Method, Quantum physics, ...) Computer Science (C/C++, Java, AI, Algorithms and data structures, ...) Economics (Accounting, entrepreneurship, Finance, ...) and Signal Processing (Signal and systems theory, Spectral analysis, Multimedia data processing, ...).

I also learned how to work under pressure, and still maintain a high level of productivity</p>
